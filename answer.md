## Do you guys know how to play chess?  
Yes, I am an experienced player, and my (online) rating is among the top 1%.  

## If yes, can you teach me?  
Let me first answer your other questions, then I'll come back to this.  

## Can an adult learn to play chess even though he/she is already old?  
Absolutely. Age is not a barrier to learning chess.  

## Is it too late now to play chess since I'm already 22, turning 23 in December?  
No, but generally, due to various factors, young people have more opportunities to improve quickly.  

## I want to be a chess master, but I don't know how to play. I always end up getting drawn in chess.  
Becoming a chess master requires a lot of dedication and financial support. If you are looking to have a successful chess channel, you do not necessarily need to be a chess master. For example, **Epic Chess** (with about 100K subscribers) and **Agadmator's Chess Channel** (over 1M subscribers) are not chess masters but intermediate players. So, streaming and being a great player are two different jobs—though some people do both successfully. 
That said, if you’re serious about improvement, it’s best to break your goal into manageable steps:

1️⃣ Learn the Rules & Basics – Make sure you can play correctly.

2️⃣ Reach an Intermediate Level – Improve through structured training.

3️⃣ Reassess Your Motivation – If you’re still passionate, push toward master

  

## Regarding your personal situation  
You mentioned:  

> "I have severe mental illness, which disrupts me from going to school. I only finished 10th grade of high school and still haven't completed 11th and 12th. I'm currently unemployed due to my condition."  

I am unaware of your exact condition, so I cannot give you promises or overly optimistic expectations. However, I can tell you this:  

Consider **Helen Keller**—many people have had similar conditions, but few have achieved her level of success. For individuals with special conditions, it is crucial not only to have strong motivation and consistent effort but also **great supporters**.  

## How to learn chess on your own  

1. **Create an account** on [Lichess](https://lichess.org) or [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com).  
2. **Learn the basics**:  
   - On Lichess, go to **LEARN → Chess Basics** to understand the rules and essential concepts.  
3. **Practice effectively**:  
   - Go to **LEARN → Practice** and work through all sections except the Knight and Bishop checkmate, which is less essential at this stage.  
   - For tactics, try the **Game Tree method**, a structured approach to calculation popularized by Kotov. Looking up his work can help you understand this technique better.  

### Study time allocation  

- **70%**: Solve puzzles and practice tactics.  
- **20%**: Play slow time-control games (10 minutes or longer) against players of similar strength.  
- **10%**: Explore additional resources like videos, streams, and articles.  

📌 **Important**: Avoid getting too deep into opening theory or advanced endgames too soon. Instead, focus on **opening principles, basic endgames, and tactical skills**—a strong foundation that will set you up for long-term improvement.  

### Finding Support  

Given your situation, I recommend you talk with a family member or close friend who might be willing to help. If your brother wants to assist, he could first learn something and then help you understand it when you face challenges.  

## Learning from my content  

I've recently created a **YouTube channel** for absolute beginners. However, my content is **scientifically precise** and might be a bit complex for some beginners. Instead of jumping into my videos alone, I suggest first finding a **study partner**. Then, using either the steps I provided above, my tutorial, or any resource you and your partner find interesting, go through it together.  

## Thinking beyond chess  

If your primary motivation is money, consider leveraging your **strengths**. For example, your English is already **better than most people’s** in the world, including mine. So, you might explore jobs related to:  

- **Translation**  
- **Dubbing**  
- **Teaching English to foreigners**  

These can be done through employment or **self-employment** (e.g., YouTube, streaming, online tutoring).  

## If you still want to learn chess...  

If you genuinely find chess **interesting** and want to give it a try, **go ahead**. Follow the steps I suggested.  

Right now, I am very busy, so I do **not** provide private lessons or consultations. However, if you start learning and later face difficulties, you can:  

- **Ask questions in the comments of my videos**  
- **Send me a private message on Lichess**  

I'll try my best to find some spare time to answer your inquiries. If needed, I may also arrange a few **free Q&A sessions** to help you find your way.  

🎯 **Good luck on your journey!**
